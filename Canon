This repository presents our organizational behavior and leadership strategy analysis for Canon U.S.A., developed as part of Hofstra University's MGT 207: Organizational Behavior and Leadership Skills for Strategic Advantage course. 
The project focuses on diagnosing leadership and communication challenges within Canon’s Marketing Department and offers evidence-based recommendations grounded in organizational behavior theory. 
Through a comprehensive assessment—including employee interviews, OB frameworks, and strategic leadership models—we propose actionable solutions such as the implementation of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) role, enhanced cross-department collaboration, and a unified communication strategy. 
This project highlights how leadership alignment and team cohesion can serve as powerful levers for sustainable organizational performance.
